;;;; BELIEF SUPPORT

;;; the implementation plan is to treat this data structure 
;;; as entirely encapsulated by a world. only the world should
;;; be able to see the structure and its functions. And even
;;; worlds should not peer inside the implementation of bs.

;;; track support for each belief
;;; for now, just keep a list for each belief that contains
;;; 'fact or a justification that the belief matches. 
;;;
;;; eventually, we want the rules to be instantiations and we
;;; may want to make the structure a bit more exciting
